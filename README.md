In this project, we perform nonlinear dimension
reduction to explore the behaviour, patterns, and
variability of the northern polar vortex. The northern
polar vortex is a climate phenomenon associated with
outbreaks of extremely cold temperatures in the Northern
Hemisphere. However, expertise in seasonal forecasting
for its effect on the surface weather in the Northern
Hemisphere is currently lacking. A better understanding of
the northern polar vortex variability and seasonality could
allow for better predictability which, in the long term,
could lead to improved weather predictions. To analyse
the vortex dynamics, we perform nonlinear dimension
reduction using an approach that approximates the eigenvalues
of the Laplace-Beltrami operator over a manifold
with a weighted Laplacian over an adjacency graph. The
first Laplacian eigenmaps found using this approximation
follow closely the patterns of Empirical Orthogonal
Functions (EOF) on the data. When diverging from EOF
patterns, Laplacian eigenmaps seem to capture organised
and consistent nonlinear dynamics EOF struggle to detect.
Furthermore, Laplacian eigenmaps retrieve an annual
seasonality in our data. To capture further dynamics and
search for other types of variability, extending Laplacian
eigenmaps to nonlinear Laplacian spectral Analysis is
suggested.
