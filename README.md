# Non-linear-feature-extraction-of-the-stratoshpere
Dynamical systems such as the climate are highly nonlinear, and despite the fact that the observations are high-dimensional, most of the dynamics is captured by a small number of physically meaningful patterns. In this project we will apply unsupervised dimension reduction techniques for feature extraction, and more specifically, the Nonlinear Laplacian Spectral Analysis (NLSA) [1] approach to extract features from potential vorticity at the level of the stratosphere. NLSA uses the information on the past trajectory of the data and thus allows us to extract representative temporal and spatial patterns. We will compare the results with linear techniques such as Principal Component Analysis.
